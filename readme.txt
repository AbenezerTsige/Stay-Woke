Stay woke is an integrated circuit that operates as a clock, alarm system, temperature sensor and heartbeat detector. 
The objective of Stay Woke is to have both a clock and an alarm system that also functions as a sleep detector to wake up the 
user. This is to ensure that the user would not be falling asleep during dangerous or inconvenient times, such as in class or 
while driving.

  The system uses the Heartbeat Module (KY039), the Temperature Humidity Sensor Module (DHT11), the Active Buzzer (KY-012), the 
Key Switch Module (KY-004), two LEDs, 2 Mini Pushbutton Switches (COM-00097), 7-Segment Quad Digit Display, the FTDI232 and 
the DC vibrator motor.
  
  The Heartbeat Module detects the user’s heart rate. If the user's heart rate is within the average sleeping rate, 40-50 BPM, 
then they would be alerted by the vibration of the DC motor. The Temperature Humidity Sensor Module is used to detect the 
temperature of the environment. The Active Buzzer is used to sound the alarm. The buzzer goes off when the time matches the 
alarm time. The Key Switch Module is used to turn off the alarm once the alarm goes off.

  The system uses two LEDs. When the user's heart rate is being read, the red LED lights up at the rate of the user’s pulse. 
The yellow LED lights up when the alarm sounds and turns off when the alarm is turned off.
There are two Mini Pushbutton Switches, one is used to adjust the hour of the displayed clock and the other is used to adjust 
the minute of the clock. The 7-segment Quad Digit Display is used to display the time and the temperature.

  The FTDI232 supplies 5 voltages to the entire circuit. The FTDI232 also provides a serial USART interface for the user, 
it displays a main menu to the screen to welcome the user and instructs them to select one of the three functions available.
